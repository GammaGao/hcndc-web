    raising a ``:py:class: ~redis.exceptions.ConnectionError`` (as the default
    ``:py:class: ~redis.connection.ConnectionPool`` implementation does), it
    makes the client wait ("blocks") for a specified number of seconds until
    a connection becomes available.
    Use ``max_connections`` to increase / decrease the pool size::
    # >>> pool = BlockingConnectionPool(max_connections=10)
    Use ``timeout`` to tell it either how many seconds to wait for a connection
    to become available, or to block forever:
    # Block forever.
    # >>> pool = BlockingConnectionPool(timeout=None)
    # Raise a ``ConnectionError`` after five seconds if a connection is
